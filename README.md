Hello,

Myself karusala varshitha.

The project that I've choosen under The Sparks Foundation , Mobile App Development is The Basic Banking System # Task-1.

It's a simple web application used to transfer virtual money between multiple users and it also records the banking transactions/activities.

The website has the following specifications :
1. Start with creating a dummy data in database for upto 10 customers. Database options: Mysql, Mongo, Postgres, etc. Customers table will have basic fields such as name, email, current balance etc. Transfers table will record all transfers happened.
2. Flow: Home Page > View all Customers > Select and View one Customer > Transfer Money > Select customer to transfer to > View all Customers .
3. No Login Page. No User Creation. Only transfer of money between multiple users
